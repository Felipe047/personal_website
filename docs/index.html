                    Hello, I'm Felipe Garcia Affonso. Currently I'm a Software Engineering student at the University of Ottawa, and the co-founder of Jolipe, a Software company.  I like to call myself an Entrepreneur, because I always look for creative ways to make money. I've tried to make money with things like selling shoes, selling used things, selling water in the beach, shoveling driveways, and doing services for people. My most successful business ventures were tutoring, and doing leaf cleanup during the fall. I've also had a few part time jobs as a construction worker and as a car detailer. One of my passions is coding. In high school I learned that programing is one of the most rewarding experiences someone can have. I've been coding for two years and I have made a few projects. Some of them are a weather app website, a stock market simulator, and a link website to direct people to my social media. During this period I've worked with C++, Python, Java, Javascript, Typescript, Swift, HTML, CSS, React, Bash, Virtual Machines, AWS, Linux, and Github. I look forward to work on Jolipe with my Friend John deploying more projects, and more business ideas. I'm also looking to work as a Software Engineering Intern.
